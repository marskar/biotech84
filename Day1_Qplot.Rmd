## Intro to R Notebooks
This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook.
When you execute code within the notebook, 
the results appear beneath the code. 

### Execute code chunks
Execute code chunks by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk
or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
You can run all code chunks by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+R* or clicking the downward arrow next to the *Run* button and selecting the final option. 

### Insert code chunks
Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

### Preview Notebook
When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

For additional useful keyboard shortcuts, please visit [this website](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts).

## Goal of this notebook
In this notebook, we will introduce the qplot function in the ggplot2 R package. This function is a great way to do quick exploratory data analysis. It is analogous to the plot function of the built-in base plotting system in R.

## About
This material is adapted from Roger Peng's [Exploratory Data Analysis Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis), which is part of the [Coursera Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) created Jeff Leek, Roger Peng and Brian Caffo of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. I highly recommend this Specialization!

I also recommend looking at Roger Peng's [Exploratory Data Analysis Course](https://leanpub.com/exdata/), which is available for little or no money (you decide!) on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com).

You can see the original source code for the [course](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/tree/master/04_ExploratoryAnalysis) and [book](https://github.com/rdpeng/exdata) on [GitHub](https://github.com).


## Load ggplot2 package

```{r}
if(!require(ggplot2)) install.packages("ggplot2")

library(ggplot2)
```


## ggplot2 "Hello, world!"

```{r}
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg)
```


## Modifying aesthetics

```{r}
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, color = drv)

```



## Adding a geom

```{r}
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, geom = c("point", "smooth"))

```


## Histograms

```{r}
qplot(hwy, data = mpg, fill = drv)

```



## Facets

```{r, fig.width=4.5}
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, facets = . ~ drv)
qplot(hwy, data = mpg, facets = drv ~ ., binwidth = 2)
```

## MAACS Cohort

- Mouse Allergen and Asthma Cohort Study
- Baltimore children (aged 5-17)
- Persistent asthma, exacerbation in past year
- Study indoor environment and its relationship with asthma morbidity
- Publication: http://goo.gl/WqE9j8

## Example: MAACS

```{r}
str(maacs)
```


## Histogram of eNO

```{r}
qplot(log(eno), data = maacs)
```


## Histogram by Group

```{r}
qplot(log(eno), data = maacs, fill = mopos)
```


## Density Smooth

```{r, fig.width=4.5}
qplot(log(eno), data = maacs, geom = "density")
qplot(log(eno), data = maacs, geom = "density", color = mopos)
```


## Scatterplots: eNO vs. PM$_{2.5}$

```{r, fig.width=2.7}
qplot(log(pm25), log(eno), data = maacs)
qplot(log(pm25), log(eno), data = maacs, shape = mopos)
qplot(log(pm25), log(eno), data = maacs, color = mopos)
```



## Scatterplots: eNO vs. PM$_{2.5}$

```{r}
qplot(log(pm25), log(eno), data = maacs, color = mopos, 
      geom = c("point", "smooth"), method = "lm")
```



## Scatterplots: eNO vs. PM$_{2.5}$

```{r, fig.width=9}
qplot(log(pm25), log(eno), data = maacs, geom = c("point", "smooth"), 
      method = "lm", facets = . ~ mopos)
```

# A final example using the MAACS dataset

## Download dataset if needed

```{r}
# make sure the maacs dataset is available in the working directory
list.files(path=".", pattern = "maacs.Rda")=="maacs.Rda"
# if FALSE, use this code to download the dataset
if(!file.exists("maacs.Rda")){download.file("https://github.com/lupok2001/datasciencecoursera/blob/master/maacs.Rda", destfile = "maacs.Rda")}
```

## Load the dataset

```{r}
load("maacs.Rda")
```

## Basic Plot

```{r, fig.width=9}
qplot(logpm25, NocturnalSympt, data = maacs, facets = . ~ bmicat, 
      geom = c("point", "smooth"), method = "lm")
```


## Summary of qplot()

- The `qplot()` function is the analog to `plot()` but with many built-in features
- Syntax somewhere in between base/lattice
- Produces very nice graphics, essentially publication ready (if you like the design)
- Difficult to go against the grain/customize (don't bother; use full ggplot2 power in that case)


## Resources

- The _ggplot2_ book by Hadley Wickham
- The _R Graphics Cookbook_ by Winston Chang (examples in base plots and in ggplot2)
- ggplot2 web site (http://ggplot2.org)
- ggplot2 mailing list (http://goo.gl/OdW3uB), primarily for developers
