## Intro to R Notebooks
This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook.
When you execute code within the notebook, 
the results appear beneath the code. 

### Execute code chunks
Execute code chunks by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk
or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
You can run all code chunks by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+R* or clicking the downward arrow next to the *Run* button and selecting the final option. 

### Insert code chunks
Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

## Goal of this notebook
In this notebook, we will use the Theoph Dataset to practice subsetting and plotting in R. We will also learn how to create a new dataset using simulation. The dataset and plotting system are built-in, so there is not need to download any additional packages for expanded plotting capabilities. 

## Exploring the Theoph dataset
Theoph is one of many example datasets in R.
List all built-in datasets in R.
```{r}
ls("package:datasets")
```

### Look at the documentation available for this dataset
```{r}
?Theoph
```

### Output the first few rows of a dataframe
```{r}
head(Theoph)
```

### Output the last few rows of a dataframe
```{r}
tail(Theoph)
```

### Check the number of rows
```{r}
nrow(Theoph)
```

### Check the number of columns
```{r}
ncol(Theoph)
```

### Check the column names for the dataset
```{r}
names(Theoph)
```

### Get summary statistics for the dataset
```{r}
summary(Theoph)
```

### Look at the structure of the dataset
```{r}
str(Theoph)
```

### Look at a row or column using [row,column] subsetting
```{r}
Theoph[51,]
Theoph[,4]
```

### Look at a particular element in dataset
```{r}
Theoph[51,2]
```

### Look at a specific column in a dataframe
```{r}
Theoph$Time
```

### Calling variables without specifying the dataset produces an error
```{r}
plot(Time, conc)
```

### Specify the dataset using $ notation or attach the dataset
```{r}
plot(Theoph$Time, Theoph$conc)
attach(Theoph) #attach a dataset to make calling variables easier
plot(Time, conc)
detach(Theoph) #be careful to detach before using another dataset
```

## Subset to answer simple questions about the Theoph dataset

### What is the mean, median, standard deviation and variance of weight?
```{r}
mean(Theoph$Wt)
median(Theoph$Wt)
sd(Theoph$Wt)
var(Theoph$Wt)
```

### How many Time measurements are less than 3 hours post dose?
```{r}
Theoph[Theoph$Time < 3,]
```

### How many rows and columns are less than 3 hours post dose?
```{r}
nrow(Theoph[Theoph$Time < 3,])
ncol(Theoph[Theoph$Time < 3,])
```

### How many measurements are at pre-dose (Time zero)?
```{r}
Theoph[Theoph$Time==0,]
```

### How many rows and columns are at pre-dose (Time zero)?
```{r}
nrow(Theoph[Theoph$Time==0,])
ncol(Theoph[Theoph$Time==0,])
```

### How many many conc measurements are above 0 at time zero?
```{r}
Theoph[Theoph$Time==0 & Theoph$conc > 0,]
```

### Subset individuals with weights between between 40 and 60kg
```{r}
Theoph[Theoph$Wt > 40 & Theoph$Wt < 60,]
```

### What is the mean of all column variables?
```{r}
lapply(Theoph, mean) # This does not work for column 1
```

### What is the mean conc by time (grouping variable)
```{r}
aggregate(Theoph$conc ~ Theoph$Time, data = Theoph, FUN = mean)
```

### What is the mean conc by time and subject (grouping variables)?
```{r}
aggregate(Theoph$conc, by = list(Theoph$Time, Theoph$Subject), FUN = mean)
```

## Basic plotting in R

### Look at basic histogram function documentation
```{r}
?hist # or
help(hist)
```

### Basic histogram plotting 
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2)) #This is needed to make a 1 row, 2 column plot
hist(Theoph$Wt, cex=1.5, xlab="Subject Body Weight (kg)", cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5, col="blue") #histogram 1
hist(Theoph$Dose, cex=1.5, xlab="Theophylline Dose (mg)", cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5, col="red") #histogram 2
```

### Look at basic scatter plot function documentation
```{r}
?plot # or
help(plot)
```

### Basic scatter plotting
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(3,3)) #This is needed to make a 3 row, 3 column plot
plot(Theoph$Time, Theoph$conc, type = "p")
plot(Theoph$Time, Theoph$conc, type = "l")
plot(Theoph$Time, Theoph$conc, type = "b")
plot(Theoph$Time, Theoph$conc, type = "c")
plot(Theoph$Time, Theoph$conc, type = "o")
plot(Theoph$Time, Theoph$conc, type = "h")
plot(Theoph$Time, Theoph$conc, type = "s")
plot(Theoph$Time, Theoph$conc, type = "S")
plot(Theoph$Time, Theoph$conc, type = "n")
#The plot function documentation explains each type
```

### Plot mean conc by time
```{r}
plot(aggregate(Theoph$conc ~ Theoph$Time, data = Theoph, FUN = mean))
```

### Make a new dataframe of mean values
```{r}
meanTheoph <- aggregate(Theoph$conc, by = list(Theoph$Time, Theoph$Subject), FUN = mean)
names(meanTheoph) <- c("Time","Subject","MeanTheophConc")
```

### Plot mean Theoph by Time again
```{r}
plot(MeanTheophConc ~ Time, data = meanTheoph)
```

### Change size of data points and axes (cex default size is 1)
```{r}
plot(Theoph$Time, Theoph$conc, type = "p", cex = 1.5,
     cex.lab = 1.5, cex.axis = 1.5)
```

### Add color to data points 
```{r}
plot(Theoph$Time, Theoph$conc, type = "p", cex = 1.5,
     cex.lab = 1.5, cex.axis = 1.5, col = "blue")
```

### Add axis labels 
```{r}
plot(Theoph$Time, Theoph$conc, type = "p", cex = 1.5,
     cex.lab = 1.5, cex.axis = 1.5, col = "blue",
     xlab = "Time (hrs)", ylab = "Theophylline Conc (ng/mL)", main = "Theophylline Conc by Time")
```

### Make 1 row, 2 columns of plots 
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(Theoph$Wt, cex = 1.5, xlab = "Subject Body Weight (kg)", cex.lab = 1.5, cex.axis = 1.5, col = "blue")
hist(Theoph$Dose, cex = 1.5, xlab = "Theophylline Dose (mg)", cex.lab = 1.5, cex.axis = 1.5, col = "red")
```

##Create a unique, simulated dataframe 

### Simulate gender
```{r}
set.seed(12345) #set seed to make dataframe creation reproducibile
n <- 50
is.female <- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5)
table(is.female)
n_fem <- sum(is.female)
n_mal <- n - n_fem
```

### Given gender, simulate age from a uniform distribution
```{r}
Age_m <- runif(n_mal, 20, 60)
Age_f <- runif(n_fem, 20, 60)
Age <- ifelse(is.female==1, Age_f, Age_m)
#Age and gender are not dependent
```

### Simulate Weight given age and gender
```{r}
wt_fem <- 65+0.02*(Age_f - 40)+rnorm(n_fem, 0, sd = 2.5)
wt_m <- 75+0.02*(Age_m - 40)+rnorm(n_mal, 0, sd = 2.5)
WT <- ifelse(is.female==1, wt_fem, wt_m)
#Conditional simulation of weight 
```

### Create data.frame
```{r}
simdata <- data.frame(is.female = is.female, WT = WT, Age = Age)
head(simdata)
```
