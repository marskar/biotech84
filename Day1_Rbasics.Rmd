This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

# Our 1st object!
```{r}
# Let's create our first object in R!

val<-3
```

When you run this code chunk, you will see that val appears in the upper right pane.

We have created a value, an object with a single data element, but objects can contain many data elements.

# Atomic versus recursive objects

Vectors are atomic objects i.e. they contain data elements that are all of the same class

Make a vector called vec: 
```{r}
# Let's create a vector
vec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

```
Lists are recursive objects i.e. they can contain many different classes of objects

Make a list called ls: 
```{r}
ls <- list(1, 2, 3, "a", "b", "c")
```

#Two-dimensional Objects

Matrices are atomic objects i.e. they contain data elements that are all of the same class

Make a matrix called m:  
```{r}
m<- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), nrow =2)

```


Data frames  are recursive objects i.e. they can contain many different classes of objects.

Make a data frame called df: 

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c("a", "b", "c"))

```


#Subsetting Objects

There are three main ways to subset objects:
```{r}
df[2] 
df[y] 
df[[2]]
df[[y]]
df$y

```



The [ ] method can return multiple objects with names included

[[ ]] and $ both return single objects without names

$ only works on recursive objects like lists and data frames
$ will not work on atomic objects like vectors and matrices

#Names

You can subset variables by row or column names.

Only the df object we created has names.

You can add names:
```{r}
names(ls)<-c("A","B","C","D","E","F")
names(ls)<-LETTERS[1:6]
colnames(m)<- LETTERS[1:2]
rownames(m)<- LETTERS[24:26]

```


You can rename columns and rows
```{r}
colnames(df)<- c("A","B")
colnames(df)<- LETTERS[1:2]

```


#Adding columns
```{r}
#Add an unnamed third column to df and m

df[,3]<-1:3
m[,3]<-1:3

#Add df to m as additional columns:
dfmc<-cbind(df,m)
#cbind will only work if row names match!

```


```{r}
#Add a column named D to df
df$D<-1:4
#This will not work for m!

```

#Adding rows

```{r}

# Add an unnamed 4th row to df and m:
df[4,]<-1:4
m[4,]<-1:4

# Add m to df as additional rows:
dfmr<-rbind(df,m)
# rbind will only work if column names match!


```


# Removing columns and rows

```{r}
# To delete the first column of m:
m <- m[ ,-1]

# To delete the B column of m:
m <- m[-B]

# To delete the first row of m:
m <- m[-1, ]

# To remove everything except column B in df:
df<-df$B

```
